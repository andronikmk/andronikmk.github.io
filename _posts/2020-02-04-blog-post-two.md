<p style="text-align: center;">
The economic development of Europe proceeded political consolidation and differentiation. 
As large sovereignties emerged and state regulation superseded guild and municipal regulation,
economic development could extend freely over a wider territories. Between 1270 and 1870 England
and Great Britain slowly progressed from the periphery of the European economy to centre-stage 
of an integrated global economy. In the process Britain escaped the Malthusian trap and by the
eighteenth century had successfully reconciled a rising population with a rising standard of living.
The following article explores data published by the Bank of England. The data-set contains a broad
set of macroeconomic and financial indicators from England and Great Britain stretching back in some cases to the C13th.
