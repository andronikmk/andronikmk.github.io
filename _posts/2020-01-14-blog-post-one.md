title: The New England Textile Industry, 1825–60
---
Prior to 1870, industry in the United States was not an integrated whole, but a sum of many heterogeneous parts spread across multiple regions. Attempting to study the economy as a whole is difficult because data is scarce, however, studying important industries in each region during a period of rapid change serves a purpose. Fortunately, rapidly changing industries or those heavily concentrated in specific regions tend to keep business records.

The cotton textile industry provide a fine example of what can be achieved using a regional approach. Cotton textile industry was heavily concentrated in the New England area and growth after 1820 was associated with the rise of a particular set of firms. There were two principal types of cotton textile firms in New England.

The firms of the Massachusetts-type, modeled after the Boston Manufacturing Company, were located on major rivers of northern New England. Generally capitalized in excess of $500,000, these were typically multi-factory operations. From the beginning, Massachusetts-type firms were fully integrated facilities producing units heavily concentrated in low-count goods or goods that drop in demand when consumer income rises. Massachusetts-type firms were responsible for the majority of textile producing from 1825–60 measured in yards.
