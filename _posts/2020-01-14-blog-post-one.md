title: The New England Textile Industry, 1825â€“60
---
Prior to 1870, industry in the United States was not an integrated whole, but a sum of many heterogeneous parts spread across multiple regions. Attempting to study the economy as a whole is difficult because data is scarce, however, studying important industries in each region during a period of rapid change serves a purpose. Fortunately, rapidly changing industries or those heavily concentrated in specific regions tend to keep business records.
